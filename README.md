# Exiles of Aether

A prototype top-down roguelike dungeon crawler inspired by the Exiles series. Built with Pygame, the project features multi-class party management, procedural vault exploration, and a suite of in-game editors for tuning your squad between delves.

## Features

- **Advanced start menu** with party management, skill laboratory, and lore codex access.
- **Procedural dungeon exploration** with grid-based traversal, camera tracking, and contextual toasts.
- **Three-member party system** drawing from bespoke archetypes with unique strengths, weaknesses, and signature skills.
- **Skills editor** to unlock and assign advanced abilities.
- **Player loadout editor** to swap gear and apply stat bonuses.
- **Merchant caravan** providing buying/selling of items gathered during runs.
- **Pause menu** for mid-run management.

## Running the game

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Use WASD/arrow keys to explore and manage menus, Enter/Space to interact, and Escape to back out of states.
